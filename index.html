      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        This presentation aims to compare MongoDB, a document-oriented NoSQL
        database, with SQL, a relational database management system (RDBMS),
        highlighting their differences in features, functionalities, and use
        cases.

      <h1>MongoDB: Embracing Flexibility</h1>
      <p>
        MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like
        documents. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB does not
        require a predefined schema, allowing for dynamic data modeling. This
        flexibility enables developers to adapt to evolving data requirements
        easily. Additionally, MongoDB offers horizontal scalability, meaning it
        can efficiently handle large volumes of data by distributing it across
        multiple servers.

      <h1>SQL: Structured and Secure</h1>
      <p>
        SQL is a widely-used relational database management system known for its
        structured data storage and transactional capabilities. In SQL
        databases, data is organized into tables with predefined schemas,
        ensuring data integrity and consistency. SQL databases support the ACID
        (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, providing
        robust transactional support for complex data operations.

      <h1>Functionality at a Glance</h1>
      <p>
        MongoDB offers a flexible schema that adapts to changing data needs,
        making it suitable for agile development and fast iteration. It also
        excels in horizontal scalability, allowing for seamless expansion as
        data volumes grow. On the other hand, SQL databases provide strong data
        integrity, transactional support, and powerful query capabilities for
        structured data, making them ideal for applications with complex
        relationships and strict data consistency requirements.

      <h1>Choosing the Right Tool for the Job</h1>
      <p>
        MongoDB is well-suited for applications requiring flexibility and
        scalability, such as content management systems, real-time analytics,
        and Internet of Things (IoT) data management. SQL databases, on the
        other hand, shine in applications with complex relationships and
        transactional requirements, such as banking systems, e-commerce
        platforms, and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. When
        selecting between MongoDB and SQL, it's essential to consider the
        specific requirements and characteristics of the application.
